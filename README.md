# BasicHandWrittenNumberRecogniser

The TrainModel.py is a basic scrip to use tensorflow to create a model on the MNIST dataset of hand written numbers.
The GUI.py is a basic Tkinter GUI where you are able to draw in digits then using the model to predic the outcome. This can also be used to further improve the model.

Also included is a copy of a pre trained model I made.
